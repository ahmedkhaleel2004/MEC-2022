# MEC-2022

This code was created in response to the McMaster Engineering 2022 Programming competition, where we were tasked with a very open-ended problem regarding ship navigation. 

This project is my first major application of essential python skills and data structures in a holistic solution.

My team and I placed **first** and won the MEC 2022 Programming competition.
